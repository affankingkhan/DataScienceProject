CMPT353 Data Science Final Project

Part 1. Using NBA player data to predict player position based on player height

Part 2. Using NBA game data to predit outcome of a specific game 

Required Libraries
---------------------
* `pip install pandas`

* `pip install numpy`

* `pip install -U scikit-learn`

* `pip install matplotlib`

* `pip install scipy`

* `pip install seaborn`

All the code is in a jupyter notebook
* `pip install notebook`

Part 1
---------------------
Look at the player_position_prediction.ipynb notebook file for part 1 code. 
The player height is in Players.csv in the home directory.
The NBA yearly player data is found in the Players_Yearly directory.
Feel free to change the file names in the notebook to other years too build your own models.

Part 2
---------------------
Look at the game_winner_prediction.ipynb notebook file for part 2 code. The game data is in the GameData directory. 
The indiviudal functions that were used to create the different features could have all been made into one functin for effeciency but this way 
it is easier to understand what feature is being added.
